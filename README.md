# Bigger Breakout Box

Replace the word prounciation audio and translation audio with the best mp3 of all time.

## Why?

My name is Jeff.

## How?

I am cheap and lazy so I don't want to pay the fee to get this on the Chrome Store. To get this working:

- Download the files and unzip them somewhere on your computer.
- Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
- Check the "Developer Mode" in the top right
- Click "Load Unpacked" and find the folder you just downloaded
- Profit?
